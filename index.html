    <h1>CapPlace Review: Is CapPlace Legit or a Scam? üö®</h1>
    <p class="rating">Rating: 1 out of 5 stars ‚≠ê</p>
    <p>CapPlace, operated by <strong>Robertson Finance Inc.</strong>, is a broker that has raised serious concerns among investors. Despite their claims of legitimacy, our investigation reveals that CapPlace is likely a scam. Here‚Äôs why:</p>

    <h2>üö© Fake Positive Reviews</h2>
    <p>CapPlace has numerous positive reviews on Trustpilot, but these are fake and manipulated. The broker is directly sponsoring 5-star ratings to appear trustworthy. Similar patterns are seen on other review websites, where the broker has suspiciously high ratings.</p>

    <h2>üö© Offshore Registration and Fake License</h2>
    <p>CapPlace claims to be registered in the <strong>Comoros Union</strong> and licensed by the <strong>MWALI International Services Authority</strong>. However, this is an offshore location with lax financial regulations, making it a haven for scam brokers. Acquiring a license here is as simple as paying a small fee, offering no real protection to investors.</p>

    <h2>üö© No History of Operation</h2>
    <p>CapPlace began operations in <strong>June 2024</strong>. They purchased a domain that is over a decade old to create the illusion of credibility. This is a common trick used by scam brokers to deceive unsuspecting investors.</p>
